# wgpu lite wrapper

Hobby project to test the Rust programming language and WebGPU through wgpu.

Used technologies: Rust, winit, WebAssembly, WebGPU, WebGL.

## Some convention choices

- coordinate system is left-handed
- triangle front face is counter clock wise

## How to launch

    cargo run

There are also some examples in the `examples` directory:

    cargo run --example cube_shader_transition

## WASM version

For the web version, you must be sure you can compile to the WebAssembly target first:

    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli

If you have Python3 installed, you can compile to WASM and host a local web server
by launching the command:

    ./run-web.sh

... then launch a browser with the displayed URL.

> [!NOTE]  
> For now, examples cannot be launched like that. Only a default example is launched.

I heavily read and used:
- [Learn WGPU tutorial](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu).
- [WebGPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/)

Mains references links are:

Having a look to some [wasm-compatible examples](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/tree/master/wgpu/examples)
did helped a lot too.
